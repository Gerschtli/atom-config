# Atom config

This is my custom atom config. Once I used the editor more heavily, now it's just a fancy scratchpad used once in a
while.

## Installation

Clone this repository into `~/.atom`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Gerschtli/atom-config ~/.atom
```

Then open atom and install [manage-packages](https://atom.io/packages/manage-packages) and let the package do its thing
(installing all packages). After that a simple restart is everything you need to be good to go :)
